üìö Introduction to Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are inspired by the principles of natural selection and evolution. They mimic the processes of selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions over generations. GAs are powerful tools for tackling complex optimization problems, exploring a vast solution space to find near-optimal solutions efficiently.

Imagine finding the best path through a maze by trying different routes and learning from each attempt. This analogy captures how GAs explore potential solutions and converge on the best one, making them ideal for solving challenges like the Vehicle Routing Problem.

üöõ The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

The VRP is a classic problem in logistics and supply chain management. It involves determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while ensuring a balanced distribution of workloads.

Why is VRP important?

Cost Reduction: Optimize delivery routes to reduce fuel consumption and travel time.
Customer Satisfaction: Improve delivery reliability and efficiency.
